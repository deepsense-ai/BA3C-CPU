# TensorFlow with Math Kernel Library support

This directory contains our fork of the TensorFlow machine learning framework (forked from version 0.11rc0). The modifications made to it consisted of adding custom convolution operations using the Math Kernel Library primitives. This was done to enhance CPU performance of convolutions.
