##### Args:


*  <b>`t`</b>: optional tensor on which the placeholder operation's name will be based
    on
*  <b>`scope`</b>: absolute scope with which to prefix the placeholder's name. None
    means that the scope of t is preserved. "" means the root scope.

    placeholder generated by the Graph Editor.
