### `tf.contrib.graph_editor.reroute_a2b_ts(ts0, ts1, can_modify=None, cannot_modify=None)` {#reroute_a2b_ts}

For each tensor's pair, replace the end of t1 by the end of t0.

B0 B1     B0 B1
|  |    => |/
A0 A1     A0 A1

The end of the tensors in ts1 are left dangling.

##### Args:


*  <b>`ts0`</b>: an object convertible to a list of `tf.Tensor`.
*  <b>`ts1`</b>: an object convertible to a list of `tf.Tensor`.
*  <b>`can_modify`</b>: iterable of operations which can be modified. Any operation
    outside within_ops will be left untouched by this function.
*  <b>`cannot_modify`</b>: iterable of operations which cannot be modified. Any
    operation within cannot_modify will be left untouched by this function.

##### Returns:

  The number of individual modifications made by the function.

##### Raises:


*  <b>`TypeError`</b>: if ts0 or ts1 cannot be converted to a list of tf.Tensor.
*  <b>`TypeError`</b>: if can_modify or cannot_modify is not None and cannot be
    converted to a list of tf.Operation.
