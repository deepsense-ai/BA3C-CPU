### `tf.contrib.graph_editor.detach_outputs(sgv, control_outputs=None)` {#detach_outputs}

Detach the output of a subgraph view.

##### Args:


*  <b>`sgv`</b>: the subgraph view to be detached. This argument is converted to a
    subgraph using the same rules as the function subgraph.make_view.
    Note that sgv is modified in place.
*  <b>`control_outputs`</b>: a util.ControlOutputs instance or None. If not None the
    control outputs are also detached.

##### Returns:

  A tuple `(sgv, output_placeholders)` where
    `sgv` is a new subgraph view of the detached subgraph;
    `output_placeholders` is a list of the created output placeholders.

##### Raises:


*  <b>`StandardError`</b>: if sgv cannot be converted to a SubGraphView using
    the same rules than the function subgraph.make_view.
