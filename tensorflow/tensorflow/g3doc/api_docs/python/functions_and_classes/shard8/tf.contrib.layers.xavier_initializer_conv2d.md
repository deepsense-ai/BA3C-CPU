### `tf.contrib.layers.xavier_initializer_conv2d(uniform=True, seed=None, dtype=tf.float32)` {#xavier_initializer_conv2d}

Returns an initializer performing "Xavier" initialization for weights.

This function implements the weight initialization from:

Xavier Glorot and Yoshua Bengio (2010):
         Understanding the difficulty of training deep feedforward neural
         networks. International conference on artificial intelligence and
         statistics.

This initializer is designed to keep the scale of the gradients roughly the
same in all layers. In uniform distribution this ends up being the range:
`x = sqrt(6. / (in + out)); [-x, x]` and for normal distribution a standard
deviation of `sqrt(3. / (in + out))` is used.

##### Args:


*  <b>`uniform`</b>: Whether to use uniform or normal distributed random initialization.
*  <b>`seed`</b>: A Python integer. Used to create random seeds. See
    [`set_random_seed`](../../api_docs/python/constant_op.md#set_random_seed)
    for behavior.
*  <b>`dtype`</b>: The data type. Only floating point types are supported.

##### Returns:

  An initializer for a weight matrix.
