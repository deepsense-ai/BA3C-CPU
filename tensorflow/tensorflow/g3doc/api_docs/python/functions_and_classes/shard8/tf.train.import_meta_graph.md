### `tf.train.import_meta_graph(meta_graph_or_file, import_scope=None, **kwargs)` {#import_meta_graph}

Recreates a Graph saved in a `MetaGraphDef` proto.

This function takes a `MetaGraphDef` protocol buffer as input. If
the argument is a file containing a `MetaGraphDef` protocol buffer ,
it constructs a protocol buffer from the file content. The function
then adds all the nodes from the `graph_def` field to the
current graph, recreates all the collections, and returns a saver
constructed from the `saver_def` field.

In combination with `export_meta_graph()`, this function can be used to

* Serialize a graph along with other Python objects such as `QueueRunner`,
  `Variable` into a `MetaGraphDef`.

* Restart training from a saved graph and checkpoints.

* Run inference from a saved graph and checkpoints.

```Python
...
# Create a saver.
saver = tf.train.Saver(...variables...)
# Remember the training_op we want to run by adding it to a collection.
tf.add_to_collection('train_op', train_op)
sess = tf.Session()
for step in xrange(1000000):
    sess.run(train_op)
    if step % 1000 == 0:
        # Saves checkpoint, which by default also exports a meta_graph
        # named 'my-model-global_step.meta'.
        saver.save(sess, 'my-model', global_step=step)
```

Later we can continue training from this saved `meta_graph` without building
the model from scratch.

```Python
with tf.Session() as sess:
  new_saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph('my-save-dir/my-model-10000.meta')
  new_saver.restore(sess, 'my-save-dir/my-model-10000')
  # tf.get_collection() returns a list. In this example we only want the
  # first one.
  train_op = tf.get_collection('train_op')[0]
  for step in xrange(1000000):
    sess.run(train_op)
```

NOTE: Restarting training from saved `meta_graph` only works if the
device assignments have not changed.

##### Args:


*  <b>`meta_graph_or_file`</b>: `MetaGraphDef` protocol buffer or filename (including
    the path) containing a `MetaGraphDef`.
*  <b>`import_scope`</b>: Optional `string`. Name scope to add. Only used when
    initializing from protocol buffer.
*  <b>`**kwargs`</b>: Optional keyed arguments.

##### Returns:

  A saver constructed from `saver_def` in `MetaGraphDef` or None.

  A None value is returned if no variables exist in the `MetaGraphDef`
  (i.e., there are no variables to restore).
