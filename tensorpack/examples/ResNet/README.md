Reproduce the results in paper "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition", [http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)
with the variants proposed in "Identity Mappings in Deep Residual Networks", [https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05027](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05027).

The train error shown here is a moving average of the error rate of each batch in training.
The validation error here is computed on test set.
